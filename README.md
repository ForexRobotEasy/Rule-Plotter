## Global Variables

- `tradeMode`: Integer variable to set the trading mode. 0 for automated trading and 1 for manual trading.
- `stopLoss`: Double variable to set the stop loss level.
- `takeProfit`: Double variable to set the take profit level.

- `orderOpenTime`: DateTime variable to store the order open time.

## OnTick Function

This is the entry point of the program, called on each tick event. It checks if the program is in automated trading mode and calls the `AlgorithmForTradingOpportunities` function to find trading opportunities. If a trade opportunity is found and no order has been executed, it places a buy/sell order using the `PlaceOrder` function.

## AlgorithmForTradingOpportunities Function

This function is responsible for searching for trading opportunities based on predefined parameters. In this sample code, the function always returns true for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own algorithm for finding trading opportunities.

## PlaceOrder Function

This function is used to place a buy/sell order with given parameters. In this sample code, it returns a random order ticket number using the `MathRand` function for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own code to place a buy/sell order.

## ModifyOrder Function

This function is used to modify an existing order with new parameters. In this sample code, it only updates the global variables `stopLoss`, `takeProfit`, and `trailingStop` for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own code to modify an existing order.

## CancelOrder Function

This function is used to cancel an existing order. In this sample code, it only updates the global variables `orderExecuted`, `orderTicket`, and `orderOpenTime` for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own code to cancel an existing order.

## OrderHistory Function

This function maintains a record of past orders. In this sample code, it only prints the order details for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own code to maintain a record of past orders.

## TestCases Function

This function contains test cases to ensure the functionality and reliability of the code. No test cases are included in this sample code. You should add your own test cases.

## OnInit Function

This function is called once when the program starts. In this sample code, it runs the test cases using the `TestCases` function.

## OnDeinit Function

This function is called once when the program ends. In this sample code, it prints the termination reason for demonstration purposes.
